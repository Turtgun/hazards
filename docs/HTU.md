# How to use this project

Look at the tools provided, find out what you want and implement it into your code. (But if you do use or modify any tool here provided you must make your implementation public and under the gpl v3 liscense. Just legal stuff tbh)

The code under src can be structured any way you want it to be, but you will probably need to change #include if you do that so be aware of that.
